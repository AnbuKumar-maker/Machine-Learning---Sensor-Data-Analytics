# Machine-Learning---Sensor-Data-Analytics
Employing machine learning to the sensors and signal data is making the devices smarter than ever. Get started with ML and Azure. Over the past few years, Deep Neural Networks have provided us the best results on a variety of problems, such as pattern recognition, computer vision, and Speech recognition and image classification.  Employing Machine Learning to the sensors and signal data is making the devices smarter than ever and is going to be a breakthrough in the field of IoT. Whether you are using sounds, vibrations, images, electrical signals or accelerometer or other kinds of sensor data, you can build richer analytics by teaching a machine to detect and classify events happening in real-time, at the edge, using an inexpensive micro controller for processing - even with noisy, high variation data.
